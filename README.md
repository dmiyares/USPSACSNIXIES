This is the United States Postal Service's automated correction service.

# EPF
This is where files will be posted for download

ACS Fulfillment files are zipped (compressed) and password protected with an 18 character password that is comprised
of alpha, numeric and special characters using PKWARE software and posted to our secure Electronic Product Fulfillment
(EPF) web site. You will need to obtain the appropriate software to retrieve the fulfillment files from our EPF web site
(most current internet browsers are supported). You will need to obtain the appropriate software package that will
decompress the data back into a normal ASCII text file. Additional software is required if you intend to automate the
updating of your database utilizing the ACS Notification File or if you intend to print out the ACS Notification File for
manual updating.
